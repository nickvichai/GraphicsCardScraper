# Scrape Newegg RTX 3070s API Docs


## Know the API

The Newegg Graphics Card Scraper API is a web scraper that pulls 
information of Graphics Cards (specifically RTX 3070s) from Neweggs 
product pages. I came up with this project came up because I wanted 
to be able to see when new RTX 3070s would come in stock on Newegg.ca. 
This API will be helpful if you are looking for a Graphic Card's:

* Item name
* Current price
* In stock status

The API currently **DOES NOT** do anything else other than give you
this information. I want to look into having it add in your custoemr
information and make a purchase for you when a Graphics Card comes in
stock.
